    >1. Research Your Destination To Find The Best Photo Opportunities</h2>

        Before your trip, I recommend researching the destination to find the
        most interesting photo opportunities.
      </p>
      <p class="post__p post__p--marginb">
        I always research the location I’m traveling to. I do this extensively
        and
        <br class="post__p--break" />obsessively!
      </p>
      <p class="post__p post__p--marginb">
        It’s up to you how much research you do. But you should definitely spend
        a bit of time looking up some great places to take pictures
      </p>
      <p class="post__p post__p--marginb">So, what kind of research can you do?</p>
      <p class="post__p post__p--marginb">
        First, you could search for photos that other people have taken at the
        locations you’re planning to visit.
      </p>
      <p class="post__p post__p--marginb">
        Search on Instagram or Google to get an idea of the kinds of photos
        people take there.

    >2. Capture Your Journey To Tell The Complete Story Of Your Travels</h2>
    <section class="post__section">

      >Travel photography isn’t just about photographing the destination.</p>
      <p class="post__p post__p--marginb">
        For a more complete photographic story, capture your journey to and from
        the location you’re visiting.
      </p>
      <p class="post__p post__p--marginb">
        If you’re traveling by plane, try to get a window seat where you have a
        view of
        <br class="post__p--break" />the wing or propeller.
      </p>
      <p class="post__p post__p--marginb">
        And of course, you could capture a beautiful aerial view of clouds,
        mountains, or city lights as you’re flying above.
      </p>
      <p class="post__p post__p--marginb">
        Your journey will often involve several different types of transport.
        And they all offer great photo opportunities.
      </p>
      <p class="post__p post__p--marginb">
        Whether you’re traveling by car, taxi, bus, train, boat, or plane, try
        to capture
        <br class="post__p--break" />some interesting photos.
